          <b id="u1192-52">1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b>
          <p id="u1192-54">When you sign up for CQNZ, you voluntarily give us certain information. You also may give us
            permission to access your information in other services. For example, you may link your Facebook account to
            CQNZ, which allows us to obtain information from this account (like your friends or contacts). The
            information we get from those services often depends on your settings or their privacy policies, so be sure
            to check what those are.</p>
          <p id="u1192-55">&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="u1192-57">We collect the following types of information.</p>
          <p id="u1192-58">&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="u1192-60">Information you provide us directly:</p>
          <p id="u1192-61">&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="u1192-63">* Your username, password and e-mail address when you register for a CQNZ account.</p>
          <p id="u1192-64">&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="u1192-66">* Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name,
            picture, phone number). This information allows us to help you or others be "found" on CQNZ.</p>
          <p id="u1192-67">&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="u1192-69">* User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the
            Service.</p>
          <p id="u1192-70">&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="u1192-72">* Communications between you and CQNZ. For example, we may send you Service-related emails
            (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices).
            Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</p>
          <p id="u1192-73">&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="u1192-75">Finding your friends on CQNZ:</p>
          <p id="u1192-76">&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="u1192-78">* If you choose, you can use our "Find friends" feature to locate other people with CQNZ
            accounts either through (i) your contacts list, (ii) third-party social media sites or (iii) through a
            search of names and usernames on CQNZ.</p>
          <p id="u1192-79">&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="u1192-81">* If you choose to find your friends through (i) your device's contacts list, then CQNZ will
            access your contacts list to determine whether or not someone associated with your contact is using
            CQNZ.</p>
          <p id="u1192-82">&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="u1192-84">* If you choose to find your friends through a (ii) third-party social media site, then you
            will be prompted to set up a link to the third-party service and you understand that any information that
            such service may provide to us will be governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p id="u1192-85">&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="u1192-87">* If you choose to find your friends (iii) through a search of names or usernames on CQNZ
            then simply type a name to search and we will perform a search on our Service.</p>
          <p id="u1192-88">&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="u1192-90">* Note about "Invite Friends" feature: If you choose to invite someone to the Service through
            our "Invite friends" feature, you may select a person directly from the contacts list on your device and
            send a text or email from your personal account. You understand and agree that you are responsible for any
            charges that apply to communications sent from your device, and because this invitation is coming directly
            from your personal account, CQNZ does not have access to or control this communication.</p>
          <p id="u1192-91">&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="u1192-93">Analytics information:</p>
          <p id="u1192-94">&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="u1192-96">* We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the
            Service. These tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you
            visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this
            analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be used to
            identify any particular individual User.</p>
          <p id="u1192-97">&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="u1192-99">Log file information:</p>
          <p id="u1192-100">&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="u1192-102">* Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a
            request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage
            or app is downloaded to your browser or device.</p>
          <p id="u1192-103">&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="u1192-105">* When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information,
            including your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs,
            number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed,
            and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our Users which then
            help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for
            more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>
          <p id="u1192-106">&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="u1192-108">Device identifiers:</p>
          <p id="u1192-109">&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="u1192-111">* When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access,
            collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device
            identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device,
            which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the
            device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data
            sent to the device by CQNZ.</p>
          <p id="u1192-112">&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="u1192-114">* A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how
            you browse and use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads.
            Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is
            impaired or disabled.</p>
          <p id="u1192-115">&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="u1192-117">Metadata:</p>
          <p id="u1192-118">&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="u1192-120">* Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example,
            Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content is
            formatted.</p>
          <p id="u1192-121">&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="u1192-123">* Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g.,
            to mark keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or other
            data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you geotag your photo
            or tag your photo using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be stored with the photo and
            searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made public by you in accordance with
            your privacy settings.</p>
          <b id="u1192-125">2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</b>
          <p id="u1192-127">In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Policy,

            Event.</p>
          <b id="u1192-153">3. SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</b>
          <p id="u1192-155">We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside CQNZ (or the group of
            companies of which CQNZ is a part) without your consent, except as noted in this Policy.</p>
          <p id="u1192-156">&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="u1192-158">Parties with whom we may share your information:</p>
          <p id="u1192-159">&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="u1192-161">* We may share User Content and your information (including but not limited to, information
